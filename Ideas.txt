I look at price upside. I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the price targets. (Money is a tool, and you want it to work for you). MarketBeat.com can show you this: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-target/

I look at the charts and the technicals. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? A site you can use to interpret the charts for you is BarChart.com and TradingView.com.

Earnings & revenue history. Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections (Lol, but https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/financials)

Growth. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. (10K for AAPL: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019319000119/a10-k20199282019.htm, 10Q for AAPL: https://last10k.com/sec-filings/aapl, for statements and investor presentations just google using GoogleNews)
